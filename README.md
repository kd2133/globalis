### Globalis: Real-Time Radar for Public Pressure

## Overview
If surveys were invented today â€” they wouldnâ€™t ask. Theyâ€™d detect.
The world speaks. Globalis listens â€” before anyone else can.

No panels. No spin. Just the truth â€” direct from society, unfiltered and in real time.
Globalis is an AI-powered early-warning system that quantifies the pressure(relevance) building in society. It detects when public attention spikes, emotions intensify, and that combination breaks from the norm â€” before unrest erupts. We turn raw signals into the GIS (Globalis Intelligence Score) â€” a real-time score from 0 to 100. Below 50? Risk is rising, often days before headlines hit.

This isnâ€™t mood tracking. Itâ€™s pressure (relevance) detection â€” for policy, crisis ops, and anyone who canâ€™t afford to be late.

## Goal
Globalis aims to make collective pressure(relevance) transparent and actionable, replacing laggy surveys with dynamic, behavior-driven insights for fair policy, crisis response, and societal understanding.

## Vision
Fair. Transparent. Universal.

The GIS enables decision-makers to detect what truly moves people â€” not just whatâ€™s loud. Global topics like climate change, migration, or inflation arenâ€™t just media-covered; theyâ€™re quantified as real-time pressure(relevance) signals.
GIS is the first step toward an AI-Governance Terminal for our time: Imagine watching a topic plunge into volatility â€” before the headlines hit.


## PIPELINE â€“ How GIS Works

# DATA INPUT 

(real time social media posts)

# TOPIC DETECTION

classify posts (e.g. Inflation, Migration)

# OPINION DETECTION

check if post is opinion based

# SENTIMENT DETECTION 

 Measures emotional intensity (positive/negative -> pro/contra).

# Relevance (this is how WE define relevance)
We detect when three forces collide:

It gets loud (attention spikes).
It gets charged (emotion intensifies).
It gets abnormal (breaks from historical baselines). 

Thatâ€™s when GIS moves â€” signaling rising relevance.

Storage & Historization
Weekly snapshots stored to track shifts over time â€” no guesswork, just patterns.
Explanation & Prediction
GIS compares developments (e.g. "Volatility rising on inflation â€” confidence crumbles"). Automatically generates insights like "Inflation panic surges â€” GIS at 32.9 signals high negative shift."
Visualization
Streamlit dashboard with:

Topic filters and interactive charts.
Color alerts (red for drops below 50).
CSV exports timestamped for audits.

Visualization Vision

Heatmaps per region: GIS + contrast on world maps (Plotly choropleth).
Stance pies: Pro/contra/neutral per topic, layered with sentiment.
Delta bars: Week-over-week changes (â†‘â†“ arrows for pressure(relevance) shifts).
Topic explorer: Drill-down on GIS evolution.
Explain layer: Mini-insights under charts (e.g. "Energy costs through the roof â€” moderate positive shift").
Comparisons: Inflation DE vs. US.
Alerts: ðŸ”´ for GIS panic levels.
